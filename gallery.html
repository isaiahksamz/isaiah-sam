    <h2>why html for companies</h>
    <p>Web development and design help to promote a company's brand name. Essentially, if a firm's website is accessible via the World Wide Web, the company is considered operating on a worldwide scale. This means that a little-known company may be looked for, and its items can be delivered to clients who are far away.
