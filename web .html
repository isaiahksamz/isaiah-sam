<p>A website (also written as a web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Examples of notable websites are Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Wikipedia.
    <h2>why html for companies</h>
    <p>Web development and design help to promote a company's brand name. Essentially, if a firm's website is accessible via the World Wide Web, the company is considered operating on a worldwide scale. This means that a little-known company may be looked for, and its items can be delivered to clients who are far away.
